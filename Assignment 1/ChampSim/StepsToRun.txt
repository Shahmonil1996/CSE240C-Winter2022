I haven't used the scripts that come with Champsim Setup as they didn't work for 
me on my Linux Deployment...

I used an Ubuntu Image And Mounted my local Path to the Docker Container.
To setup the Ubuntu Image, I had to run these steps everytime.....

apt-get update
apt install vim
apt install make
apt install g++
apt install wget

ChampSim Setup and Winner Codes should be taken from Website...

I updated the script that I used to run, its not a functional change, I just 
removed the space on Line 2 in original file for the following scripts:
-> build_champsim.sh => build_champsim_working.sh 
-> run_champsim.sh   => run_champsim_working.sh 
-> run_4core.sh      => run_4core_working.sh

Baseline : Without Instruction Prefetcher
Binary Run Command : bash build_champsim_working.sh hashed_perceptron no next_line spp_dev no lru 1

DJOLT :
Binary Run Command : bash build_champsim_working.sh hashed_perceptron D_JOLT next_line spp_dev no lru 1
-> Design Space Exploration
	--> Update LongRangePrefetcherDistance to 10,20,25,30 keeping other things constant
	--> Update ShortRangePrefetcherDistance to 2,6,8,10 keeping other things constant
	--> Updated TrainingTableSize and MonitoringTableSize to 8,32,48,64 and ketp other things constant

-> First Order to get Quarter, Half, Double and Quadruple Hardware budget fitting structure
	--> Updated ShortRangePrefetcher_N_Sets to 512,1024,4096,8192  
	--> Updated LongRangePrefetcher_N_Sets  to 256,512,2048,4096
	--> Updated ExtraMissTable_N_Sets       to 64,128,512,1024
	--> Additional change required for Signature bit to be 22 for Half and 21 for Quarter , no changes for other 

FNL+ MMA: (There were two versions of the code on IPC website so I downloaded original code and modified the name
of the file to be FNL-MMA.l1_pref)
Binary Run Command :  bash build_champsim_working.sh hashed_perceptron FNL-MMA280520 next_line spp_dev no lru 1 (Updated Code)
Binary Run Command :  bash build_champsim_working.sh hashed_perceptron FNL-MMA next_line spp_dev no lru 1       (Original Code)

-> Design Space exploration
	--> Updated MMA_FILT_SIZE to 10,15,20,30 keeping other things constant
	--> Updated DISTAHEAD     to 10,20,25,30 keeping other things constant
	--> Updated PERIODRESET   to 2048,4096,16384,32768 keeping other things constant

-> First Order to get Quarter, Half, Double and Quadruple Hardware budget fitting structure
	--> Updated LOGMULTSIZE to be -2,-1,1,2 for Quarter, Half, DOuble and Quadruple Sizes

Traces used for Baseline Versions : All 50
Traces used for Design Space Exploration and First Order Structure : 20
Filename that has names of those 20 Traces : scripting/trace_name_trimmed.txt
Traces are downloaded and stored in a Folder Called "Traces/ipc1_public"

Scripts used to run the Traces in background : 
-> all_night_script.sh
-> all_night_script2.sh

Script used to extract Data : 
-> extract.sh

Binaries were created first by changing the parameters in the prefetcher code and renaming them
